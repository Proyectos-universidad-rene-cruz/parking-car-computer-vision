# parking-car-computer-vision

This is a tutorial from YouTube if you want to watch the content in the following [link](https://youtu.be/caKnQlCMIYI?si=ohtaU3By7zEsYMz6). The video is clear and this repository code uses the same observation case but applied in the whole parking car scenario, feel free to update it and create a better code.

## Objective

The objective of this code is to implement a solution in the UAEMex parking car (university) by applying all the concepts explained in the [link](https://youtu.be/caKnQlCMIYI?si=ohtaU3By7zEsYMz6)
In the future, we want to change the videos and image case observation for our own content.

### How to use

1. Create a CarParkPos file running the Python script ParkingSpackePicker.py, this file creates a base image specifying the parking spaces; you can modify this content in order to satisfy your observation case.`
2. Download the video of the parking car, you can download it [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QPHknNg-CiKVVOjObRVaRnUA1I-GlL4H)
3. Run the Main.py script by selecting the specified video.
4. Enjoy and learn!
